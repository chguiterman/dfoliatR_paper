  \begin{abstract}
  We present a new R package to provide dendroecologists with tools to
  identify, quantify, analyze, and visualize growth suppression events in
  tree rings produced by insect defoliation. The `dfoliatR' library is
  based on the Fortran V program OUTBREAK, and builds on existing
  resources in the R computing environment. `dfoliatR' expands on OUTBREAK
  to provide greater control of supression thresholds, additional output
  tables, and high-quality graphics. To use `dfoliatR' requires
  standardized ring-width measurements from insect host trees and an
  indexed tree-ring chronology from local non-host trees. It performs an
  indexing procedure to remove the climatic signal represented in the
  non-host chronology from the host-tree series. It then infers
  defoliation events in individual trees. Site-level analyses identify
  outbreak events that synchronously affect a user-defined number or
  proportion of the host trees. Functions are available for summary
  statistics and graphics of tree- and site-level series.

\section{Overview of the software}\label{overview-of-the-software}}

The \texttt{dfoliatR} library requires two sets of tree-ring data to
identify defoliation and outbreak events:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Standardized ring-width series for individual trees of the host
  species
\item
  Standardized tree-ring chronology from a local non-host species
\end{itemize}

Users can develop these data sets in software of their choosing, such as
in \texttt{dplR} or ARSTAN. It is important that the host-tree data
include only one tree-ring series per tree. Both \texttt{dplR} and
ARSTAN have options for averaging mutliple sample series into a
tree-level series. The tree-ring series and chronology can be read into
R via several available \texttt{dplR} functions.

\texttt{dfoliatR} begins to identify defoliation events in individual
trees by removing the climatic signal as represented by the non-host
chronology from the host tree series. This indexing procedure creates a
series -- the ``growth suppression index'' -- in which disturbance is
the predominant signal. Negative departures in the growth suppression
index that surpass user-defined thresholds in duration, and magnitude
will be defined as \emph{defoliation events}. The individual tree
defoliation series are composited in an additional step to identify
\emph{outbreak events} that synchronously affect mutliple trees. Users
have options to define the number and/or the proportion of trees
required for a defoliation event to be considered an outbreak.

Note that these methods of separating tree- vs site-level disturbance
categories is a major departure from the OUTBREAK program. In OUTBREAK
the two levels of analysis are combined and users have more limited
control of thresholds to define defoliation events versus outbreaks.

\hypertarget{availability-and-installation}{%
\section{Availability and
installation}\label{availability-and-installation}}

The \texttt{dfoliatR} is provided free and open source (Guiterman,
2020). It is provided to R users via the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN; \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}). To install \texttt{dfoliatR}
into R from CRAN use

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dfoliatR"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In each R session, \texttt{dfoliatR} can be loaded via

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(dfoliatR)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Development versions of \texttt{dfoliatR} are available on Github and
installed using the \texttt{devtools} library in R,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{devtools}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{install_github}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"chguiterman/dfoliatR"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Support documentation is provided within the package via help menus
(accessed by typing \texttt{?} before a function name), this paper, and
on the package website (\url{https://chguiterman.github.io/dfoliatR/})
which includes updated vignettes. Code to execute a preprint of this
manuscript and the code included below is available at (\emph{insert
later}).
